CALLIE-BOT
=============
Made to address a problem where I'm always online discord, but back when I didn't have a phone if my friends weren't online I had no way to contact them. I created a texting bot using SMS Gateways I collected by getting my friends phone numbers and noting their cell phone carriers.
Works using Gmail primarily, but can be modified to use any SMTP server. 

DEPENDENCIES
=============
Python 3.6.5

pip install discord.py

A G-Mail account with an application token

NOTE
=============
The "temp.py" files must be edited and the underscore temp removed from the
name before the application will run.
